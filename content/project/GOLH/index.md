I supervised a student, Abigail Schwartz, who worked with me on this project to provide an exploratory data analysis of data from GOLH's Pour Tour. Together we produced a short report detailing and visualizing the distributions of various characteristics of Pour Tour participants, include age, prize choices, and location. In addition to a simple market segmentation, we also included recommendations for future data collection based on questions of interest to GOLH.
