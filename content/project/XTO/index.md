XTO was testing the use of a new technology and surveyed an employee about its effectiveness in 10 different settings. In each setting, the survey included Likert-scale questions about various aspects of the technology's effectiveness. I produced an appendix to their report about the new technology, summarizing the survey data. My analysis included descriptive statistics and hypothesis tests for repeated measures data, such as Friedman's Rank Sum test and Conover's post-hoc test for comparing mean rank differences.
