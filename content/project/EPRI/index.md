The goal of this project was to statistically compare the effectiveness of two different sampling strategies for testing electrical breakers at power plants. The two sampling designs were compared through numerous Monte Carlo simulations, which measured effectiveness as the percentage of failed breakers tested and replaced. Secondary measures of effectiveness, such as the average time (in years) to identify and replace a failed breaker, were also tracked and used for comparison. In addition to performing the simulations, I assisted in writing the report based on the simulation study.
