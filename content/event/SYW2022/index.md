abstract: Classical education has enjoyed tremendous growth in recent years, both in home and traditional school settings.  In this breakout session we will begin by sharing statistics and success stories highlighting classical educationâ€™s importance today.  Next, we will explain the classical view on the purpose of education, and conclude with a look at the unique features of its pedagogy.  There will be time for questions at the end, and we hope you will join us for this opportunity to learn about the enduring value of an education that opens youth up to all that is Good, True, and Beautiful.
