I am an associate professor of statistics and business data analytics at Saint Vincent College. I enjoy teaching classes ranging from introductory business statistics to econometrics to courses in data science and business analytics. I am also the Chairperson of the Marketing, Analytics, and Global Commerce Department, affectionately known as the MAGIC Department.

My research focuses on developing and applying methods for functional and longitudinal data. My past and current research projects span a variety of fields, including medicine, psychological counseling, economics, and more. I also work as a statistical consultant and enjoy the variety of challenges I encounter between my research and consulting projects.
