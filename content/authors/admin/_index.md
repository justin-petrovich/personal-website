I am an assistant professor of business statistics and business data analytics in the Business Administration Department at Saint Vincent College. I enjoy teaching a variety of classes ranging from introductory business statistics to econometrics to courses in data science and business analytics.

My research interests include developing methods for functional and longitudinal data analysis, applied statistics, and statistics education. His past and current research projects span medicine, psychological counseling, and economics. Recently, I have begun statistical consulting projects as well and enjoy involving students in both my research and consulting work.
